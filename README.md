# Leaflet-Challenge

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is tasked with providing scientific information on natural hazards, the health of ecosystems and the environment, and the effects of climate and land-use changes. Their scientists create innovative tools and methods to deliver timely, relevant, and valuable insights about Earth's processes.

The USGS aims to develop new tools to visualize their earthquake data. Although they collect vast amounts of data from around the world daily, they currently lack an effective way to display it. In this challenge, your task is to create a visualization solution for USGS data to help better inform the public and government agencies, and potentially secure more funding for addressing global issues.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Reference of this wensite is:
